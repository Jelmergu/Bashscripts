# Bashscripts

This repository contains several bash scripts that I developed for easy use.

## Installing scripts
Installing these script is quite easy, as the Bashstart.sh will include all the files to the shell.

Execute the following to install the complete bashscript library.
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Jelmergu/Bashscripts.git .
echo "${PWD}/Bashscript/Bashstart.sh" >> /path/to/bashrc
```
Replace `path/to/bashrc` with the location of your bashrc file, which is probably one of the following:
- `~/.bashrc` for most *nix systems
- `/etc/bash.bashrc` for git-bash on windows
